1.4.0
*	NEW: Network plugin; Input data handlers/validators moved to separate
	Data plugin
*	NEW: F3::invert() method inverts colors of specified JPG/GIF/PNG image
*	NEW: Assigning a function or class/method to the UNLOAD global variable
	instructs the framework to execute the specified code before the
	application shuts down
*	NEW: Better caching; Level-1 and Level-2 cache hits/misses added to
	F3::profile() method
*	NEW: Axon->findOne() and M2->findOne() methods for retrieving the first
	record (or collection object, in the case of M2) that matches the
	specified criteria
*	NEW: Auth::HTTP() provides basic HTTP authentication against a user-
	configurable back-end (LDAP, IMAP, sqlDB, or nosqlDB)
*	Change in behavior: record offset is now a separate argument in
	F3::lookup(), F3::find(), F3::findOne()
*	Transliteration of consecutive non-RFC 1738 characters in F3::slug() now
	evaluated as a single hyphen
*	F3::validEmail() now has option to check if DNS MX records exist for the
	domain associated with the e-mail address
*	Level-1 cache size limit enforced
*	Unit test method expect() moved to Expansion pack
*	Bug fix: F3:include directive

1.3.24
*	NEW: F3::slug() returns URL-friendly version of string argument (also
	converts Latin diacritics to 7-bit equivalents); F3::route() now
	complies with RFC 1738 specifications for characters that need no
	URL-encoding
*	NEW: Multiple request methods in F3::route
		F3::route('GET|POST /whodunnit',
			function() {
				echo 'I did';
			}
		);
	In this example, the framework makes no distinction between GET and POST
	methods and will route the request to the same handler
*	NEW: validCaptcha() returns TRUE if SESSION.captcha is set and has a
	value identical to the argument passed to this method
*	NEW: Framework will reroute attempts to hotlink a resource (a Web page,
	image, media file, etc.) to the URL (or route) defined in the HOTLINK
	global variable; If such variable exists, the framework will prohibit
	access to an F3::route() with FALSE as the fourth argument (see the quick
	reference for details) - this is particularly useful for preventing
	bandwidth theft
*	F3::send() now supports partial downloads
*	Performance improvements in graphics generators: F3::captcha(),
	F3::fakeImage(), F3::thumb(), and F3::identicon()
*	Bug fix: frameset treated by template engine as an empty HTML tag
*	Bug fix: CLI output

1.3.23
*	Lots of code optimization and performance improvements
*	Framework methods dependent on PHP's GD extension, i.e. identicon(),
	thumb(), captcha(), and fakeImage(), have been removed from the
	Expansion Pack; these methods have been reclassified and now belong to
	the Graphics plugin - there should be no effect in existing applications
	if graphics.php is saved in the autoload/ folder
*	Results returned by F3::http() are now cached if the framework receives
	HTTP Cache-Control and Expires headers from remote host
*	More specific error message when PHP's PCRE fails
*	Bug fix: XCache auto-detection
*	Bug fix: Error when PHP intl extension is not installed and i18n plugin
	is in autoload folder
*	Bug fix: Spaces removed from some CSS rules by F3::minify() are not
	accepted/understood by MSIE
*	Bug fix: Reconstruction of HTTP deflate-encoded data
*	Bug fix: Signed/unsigned floats with exponents in template expressions

1.3.22
*	Case-insensitive autoload classes
*	Bug fix: Cache::prep() fails on file system back-end

1.3.21
*	NEW: F3::pick() method for retrieving values of a named column from a
	framework array variable
*	NEW: F3::sqlBind() method for late binding of values to parameters in
	SQL statement:-
		F3::sqlBind(
			'SELECT * FROM products WHERE quantity>:specified',
				array(':specified'=>array(28,PDO::PARAM_INT))
		);
	or:-
		F3::sqlBind(
			'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=:id AND hash=:md5pwd',
				array(
					':id'=>array(2135890,PDO::PARAM_INT),
					':md5pwd'=>'5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592'
				)
		);
	If the parameter is not associated with any data type, or the value
	matching the parameter is a scalar, PDO::PARAM_STR is assumed
*	F3::qq() deprecated; use the more reliable F3::sqlBind() method
*	NEW: [maps] section in configuration files for passing URLs and classes
	(as key-value pairs) to the F3::map() method
*	Change in behavior: F3::input() now converts special characters to HTML
	entities automatically as an additional security measure; if you wish to
	display form input containing HTML in your templates, use:-
		{htmlspecialchars_decode(@var)} or {html_entity_decode(@var)}
*	Change in behavior: i18n plugin/template extension usage simplified;
	instead of searching $_REQUEST['lang'] and $_SESSION['lang'] for the
	default language, you may now specify the default in F3's LANGUAGE
	variable - if not specified, the plugin checks the HTTP request for an
	Accept-Language header; as a last resort, F3 retrieves the value
	returned by Locale::getDefault(); automatic instantiation of session
	variable $_SESSION['lang'] is now deprecated
*	Change in behavior: EXEMPT now defaults to NULL; framework automatically
	excludes all private IP address ranges from spam checks
*	copyTo() method (both Axon and M2) now has optional 2nd argument for
	selecting fields to be copied to target framework variable
*	Stack trace filter improved and array keys now appear in traces
*	F3::set(), F3::get(), and F3::clear() now allow mixture of traditional
	and dot-notation in framework variables
*	MongoID property, i.e. _id field, now accessible after insertion of M2
	object in the database
*	F3::mock() now recognizes additional GET query variables directly
	specified in URI
*	Lots of program tweaks, security enhancements, and bug fixes (entire
	framework test suite reconstructed; now more extensive than before)

1.3.20
*	NEW: M2->lookup() method with map-reduce capability
*	MemCache removed from cache engine back-end auto-detection due to
	additional parameters required to set it up
*	Added check for aborted connection in F3::send()
*	More detailed stack traces for uncaught PHP exceptions
*	More informative message when directory write fails due to incorrect
	permissions
*	Methods related to manipulation of framework variables optimized
*	F3::send() and F3::transpose() methods moved to Expansion pack
*	Bug fix: F3::checkRoute() is private
*	Bug fix: Namespaced classes

1.3.19
*	Cache engine is now a separate class (pre-loaded) and supports XCache
	as a an additional back-end; To use, simply install and activate the
	PHP xcache extension, then issue the following command:-
		F3::set('CACHE','xcache');
*	Cache back-end auto-detection
*	Framework's extensions/ folder merged with autoload/ to make
	non-template public methods available for direct use by applications
*	Variable identifiers normalized before saving to symbol table

*	Bug fix: F3::identicon() IBLOCKS variable
*	Bug fix: M2 code profiling

1.3.17
*	Removed F3::config()'s dependence on PHP's buggy parse_ini_file()
	function; Also added support for F3's array dot notation and automatic
	array creation when comma-separated values are present; Use double-
	quotes if whitespaces and commas are significant
*	SQL-related methods have been moved to a separate class: the SQLDB
	pack; if you use the Axon ORM, sqldb.php must also be in the AUTOLOAD
	folder due to this dependency
*	Bug fix: F3::clear() does not remove variable from symbol table
*	Bug fix: DEBUG filtering

1.3.16
*	Framework-created folders now have 0755 folder permissions
*	M2 modified to use new cache engine
*	Added check for incorrect magic_quotes_gpc configuration
*	Bug fix: F3::call()

1.3.15
*	NEW: F3::config() method for reading .ini files to separate code from
	user-configurable application parameters; Fat-Free auto-generates the
	corresponding PHP code and caches the snippets for optimum performance;
	download fatfree-ini.zip to see an example
*	NEW: SERVER and ENV framework variables to mirror PHP's $_SERVER and
	$_ENV globals for use in templates
*	Support for PHP validate/sanitize/other filters, flags, and filter
	options added to the F3::input() method
*	Bug fix: RFC1738-compliant URI characters in routing tokens
*	Bug fix: Runtime::call()

1.3.14
*	NEW: More powerful 2-level cache engine now allows framework variable
	persistence:
		F3::set('x',123,TRUE); // persists variable 'x' in RAM and cache
		echo F3::get('x'); // retrieves variable from cache if found
		F3::clear(x'); // removes variable from cache and RAM if found
		F3::cached('x'); // returns array(unixtime,bytes) or FALSE
	Cache back-end is defined by setting CACHE global variable:
		F3::set('folder=./cache'); // default (filesystem)
		F3::set('apc'); // use APC as back-end
		F3::set('memcache=localhost:11211'); // MemCache as back-end
*	NEW: F3::mset() method for multi-variable assignment using PHP
*	NEW: LOADED global variable contains list of loaded PHP extensions
	associative arrays
*	Change in behavior: Spam-checking now turned off by default; you
	should assign a blacklist service to DNSBL global variable manually if
	your wish to validate user IP addresses against the specified service
*	Fastest F3 version to-date and now the fastest PHP framework too!
	Performance tweaks everywhere

	criteria

1.3.11
*	NEW: Geo::weather() returns current weather conditions for a specified
	location defined by latitude and longitude; Hint: use Geo::timezones()
	to get latitude/longitude data
*	Bar-separated (|) list of HTML form fields now accepted by F3::input()
	method; makes it easier to apply a common validation/processing rule
	to a set of fields
*	i18n extension and F3::minify() now allow F3 expressions inside custom
	tags and base folder argument, respectively
*	Removed Runtime class from stack trace
*	Bug fix: autoload class reloading

1.3.10
*	NEW: Yahoo::online() method for checking whether a particular user
	is logged into Yahoo Messenger
*	Bug fix: XmlTree::traverse passing closures by value

1.3.9
*	NEW: Geo plugin for common world-related reference tables (countries
	and time zones)
*	F3::expect(), Expansion::http(), and xmlTree::traverse() refactored
*	Change in behavior: Default IMPORTS, CACHE, AUTOLOAD, EXTENSIONS,
	FONTS, LOGS, and GUI paths are now relative to location of app's main
	index.php instead of the previous $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] setting
*	Bug fix: Import file regex

1.3.8
*	NEW: Yahoo! Web services plugin
*	Added check for absence of routes/route handlers

*	Bug fix: Google::feed() doesn't return QUIET global variable to prior
	state

1.3.7
*	Faster bootstrap
*	Automatic log rotation feature added to custom logger plugin
*	Display of errors suppressed after first one has been displayed; ERROR
	global variable still contains latest error detected by framework
*	Bug fix: Class onLoad() inadvertently triggered by is_callable()
*	Bug fix: Greedy regex in F3::serve()
*	Bug fix: F3::call() unable to find import file
*	Bug fix: M2 verification of existing MongoDB collections

1.3.6
*	NEW: LOGS global variable and custom logger plugin; sample usage:-
		F3::set('LOGS','logs/');
		$log=new Log('test.log');
		$log->write('any string');
		$z=array(1,2,3);
		$log->write(var_export($z));
		unset($log);
*	NEW: F3::validEmail method
*	Routing engine now accepts template expressions in route handlers, e.g.
		F3::route('GET /forum/@thread/@topic','Forum::{@thread(@topic)}');
*	Tweaked template engine so it doesn't strip tabs, carriage returns and
	line feeds from template expressions

1.3.2
*	Worked around PHP libxml bug that results in some F3:exclude blocks
	being invisible and thereby unprocessed by the template engine
*	Expansion pack thumb() method refactored due to filesystem issues on
	Windows platforms
*	Bug fix: Some HTML entities incorrectly rendered by template engine

1.3.1

	tags are absent in template, they won't appear in rendered output
	anymore
*	Exception handler activated during bootstrap
*	F3:check now allows relational operators > and <

1.3.0
*	NEW: Simplified framework packaging
*	NEW: Flexible autoload engine for user-defined classes
*	Framework is now back to its single-file design - everything else is a
	plugin, including the original Expansion Pack
*	Additional safety check when assigning objects to framework variables;
	Now triggers an error when object does not implement __set_state method
*	Bug fix: Framework variable name conflicts with PHP define()
*	Bug fix: Akismet plugin

1.2.21
*	Bug fix: F3:include directive with null/false/empty href expression
	(derived from a parent F3:check directive) triggers an error

1.2.20
*	Bug fix: Session handling issue

1.2.19
*	NEW: HEADERS global variable contains list of HTTP headers received
	from server queried by F3::http method
*	More code optimization
*	Bug fix: Axon NULL handling

1.2.18
*	NEW: EXEMPT global variable allows you to specify which IP addresses
	should not be cross-checked against spam blacklists; Default value is
	127.0.0.1
*	Bug fix: Routing engine doesn't trigger 404 on extra URI elements

1.2.17
*	Framework now searches all possible URI matches in routes before
	giving up and displaying a "no route handler found" message; Fat-Free
	still prioritizes fixed routes over those containing tokens
*	Security update: Vulnerability in routing engine
*	F3::mock and F3::expect are now part of the Core Pack to align
	dependencies

1.2.16
*	Bug fix: ternary template expressions using F3::repeat keys not handled
	properly

1.2.15
*	More performance tweaks
*	F3::serve code optimization
*	User-defined PHP functions are still allowed in templates, but
	class/object methods in templates have been deprecated to ensure object
	integrity and prevent indiscriminate use resulting in security leaks
*	Bug fixes: Expansion pack HTTP headers
*	Bug fix: Ternary expressions in templates

1.2.14
*	F3::sql now returns result set; If SQL command is a SELECT, return
	value is identical to DB.result; Not particularly useful on other
	SQL statements and batch transactions
*	F3::copyFrom method now checks if argument value is an array
*	Template engine performance tweaks
*	Additional validation in spam detection engine; in cases where the Web
	server doesn't reliably return correct remote addresses

1.2.10
*	F3::serve is now more AJAX-friendly
*	Bug fix: Rendering of RSS templates

1.2.9
*	Axon reset method is now public to allow dehydration without the need
	for instantiating a new object - specially useful when doing successive
	inserts
*	Bug fix: Axon skip method

1.2.8
*	Bug fix: code profiler's DB.cache element not indexed properly

*	Minor performance tweaks in template engine
*	Bug fix: Apache-specific function in bootstrap code
*	Bug fix: spam detection for private IPs

1.2.6
*	F3::repeat template directive now has a new HTML/XML attribute: "key".
	Whereas the "index" attribute returns the value of the current element
	in the iteration, "key" returns the array key of the element. This
	eliminates the need to use {array_search(@index,@group)} just to get
	the key; This also solves issues related to the use of array_search
	function on arrays with duplicate values - see updated online
	documentation and sample applications in the downloads section of the
	SourceForge project site
*	Code refactoring: reverted to direct use of class properties in private
	stash method due to severe degradation in PHP performance when passing
	properties by reference (experienced only when using large templates:
	10,000+ HTML elements)

1.2.5
*	More informative error messages when index or group attributes in
	F3::repeat template directive cannot be resolved
*	Spammer detection engine now generates HTTP 404 message by default
*	Bug fix: F3::include directive

1.2.4
*	F3db sync method now uses DB as default database ID
*	AUTOLOAD now allows class hierarchies to reside in similarly named
	subfolders; so if you want to autoload a PHP 5.3 namespaced class
	that's invoked this way:-
		$obj=new gadgets\ipad; // or gadgets\ipad::start();
	you should create a folder hierarchy that follows the same structure:
		autoload/gadgets/ipad.php
*	PDO extensions now checked if loaded prior to use
*	DNSBL engine now sniffs real IP address if user is behind a proxy
*	Corrections in the cheat sheet

1.2.3
*	NEW: SPAM global variable; Reroutes spammers to the specified URL
	automatically
*	NEW: DNSBL variable; Blacklist(s) used by the spammer-blocking engine;
	Default value is dnsbl.sorbs.net
*	NEW: AUTOLOAD variable; Points to path where framework autoloads
	undefined classes (default value is /classes); If class contains a
	start() method, it is automatically used as a bootstrap
*	Expansion Pack's identicon method now allows template expression as
	argument
*	Bug fix: copyFrom method doesn't set Axon status to hydrated

1.2.2
*	NEW: Multiple databases (see online documentation for details); As a
	consequence, Axon constructor and sql method syntax have been modified
	a bit (may break your existing code if you specified cache timeouts; it's
	just the order of the arguments that changed - so this should be easy to
	fix)
*	NEW: Bandwidth throttling for high-traffic Web sites and protection
	against DOS attacks; THROTTLE global variable allows you to specify the
	minimum run-time duration of your application (in milliseconds)
*	Expansion Pack's http method now accepts an optional 4th argument;
	if TRUE (default) follows redirection (HTTP Location header) to any
	page
*	Bug fix: XML encoding

1.2.1
*	NEW: transpose method rotates a two-dimensional framework array
	variable, i.e. rows become columns, and vice versa
*	Change in behavior: TEST global variable array restructured to match
	SQL query presentation; rows match each invocation of the expect method,
	each row having a "result" and "text" column; To emulate previous
	framework behavior just add an F3::transpose('TEST') before using the
	variable
*	expect method now returns text result of assertion, i.e. the "pass" or
	"fail" message
*	Unit testing tools mock and expect methods now part of Expansion Pack
	to reduce overhead on production systems
*	Change in behavior: profile method now returns cached and executed SQL
	commands instead of simply counting queries; fonts loaded and
	corresponding file sizes also added
*	Cache TTL of Axon sync now set to a default of 60 seconds
*	Lots of F3db code optimization
*	PNG images generated by Expansion Pack methods are now compressed
*	CAPTCHA and router code refactored
*	Framework exception handler now uses debug_backtrace as fallback if
	exception's getTrace is empty
*	Contents of PHP's $_GLOBALS variable now suppressed from stack trace
	for added security - appears only as array(GLOBALS)
*	RESTful interface map method now accepts objects and PHP class names as
	an argument
*	Template engine does not display *Error* anymore when illegal functions
	are used; it just appears as plain text for easier debugging
*	Bug fix: Template rendering of empty F3::repeat blocks
*	Bug fix: SQL rollback
*	Bug fix: Aspect ratio of thumbnails
*	Bug fix: exists method not working properly with multi-dimensional arrays
*	Bug fix: URL caching
*	Bug fix: recursive display of GLOBALS in the stack trace when error is
	triggered by an application exhausts PHP memory
*	Bug fix: mock method doesn't set REQUEST framework variable when passing
	simulated GET/POST key-value pairs

1.2.0
*	NEW: Database Pack now combines Fat-Free's SQL handler and Axon ORM in
	a single package; Core and Expansion Packs are thinner due to this
	reorganization - combined package still weighs in at 78KB!
*	NEW: Variable variables
*	NEW: F3::send method for handling file download requests
*	NEW: Axon def, undef and isdef methods for virtual fields (see updated
	Axon ORM section of online documentation)
*	Change in behavior: Axon found method now returns number of rows that
	match specified (instead of a boolean value)
*	Axon load method now accepts sort sequence as second argument to help in
	SQL navigation
*	Axon find and lookup methods now allow query caching
*	ob_gzhandler now disabled if Apache mod_deflate is active
*	Double-quotes in strings now handled safely; converted automatically to
	XML entity &#34; to help protect against SQL injection
*	Framework now triggers an error if run on <5.3 PHP version
*	Bug fix: Decoding of HTML entities in F3::check tags during template
	rendering
*	Bug fix: Error and exception handling in bootstrap code
*	Fixed inaccuracies and conflicting statements in online documentation

1.1.3
*	NEW: skip method for Axon pagination; useful for retrieving the N-th
	record relative to current following the same criteria used to hydrate
	the Axon (see updated Axon ORM section of the online documentation)
*	NEW: Limits on number of records retrieved by Axon lookup and find
	methods added to argument lists
*	Forms handler, Axon ORM and SQL handler now provide better support for
	UTF-8: tested against data from http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/utf8.html
*	More performance tweaks: HTML/XML templates rendered faster
*	Framework now supports non-Apache servers
*	Closures provide no value to stack traces; filtered out
*	Lots of code refactoring

1.1.2
*	TEST variable now has two indices: TEST.result returns an array of
	boolean values, TEST.text returns an array of string values; Elements
	of both arrays correspond with the results of every F3::expect in
	your code (see the updated Unit Testing section of the online
	documentation)
*	Template tokens in F3::expect pass/fail messages now allowed
*	F3::resolve code optimization; template rendering speed improved
*	Bug fix: resurgent error in Javascript/CSS fragments
*	Bug fix: Axon error messages

1.1.1
*	Quick bug fix in bootsrap code

1.1.0
*	NEW: Code profiler! Use the new F3::profile method to get detailed
	runtime information about your application (see online documentation
	for more details)
*	Change in behavior - automatic sanitation of PHP globals, i.e. removal
	of ALL HTML/PHP tags, has now been deprecated to accommodate Javascript
	textarea editors like TinyMCE, CKEditor, etc. so these scripts can pass
	data containing HTML tags; Workarounds: Use F3::scrub to clean variables
	programmatically (before using PHP globals like $_REQUEST, $_SESSION,
	etc.) or specify the HTML tags allowed in specific input fields;
	Details in the online documentation (Forms Handler section)
*	F3ex is now a totally-separate class but still dependent on the F3 class
*	Performance improvement in large HTML templates
*	Due to the number of significant features introduced, we decided to skip
	the release of version 1.0.1 release (mostly bug fixes mentioned here)
	and head straight for 1.1.0!
*	Bug fix: Dynamic sitemap character set encoding
*	Bug fix: Non-quoted keys and array dot notation work fine but quoted
	elements inside user-defined framework array variables are not handled
	properly

1.0.0
*	NEW: Axon auto-mapping ORM (see online documentation for more details)
*	Refactoring of bootstrap code and expansion pack loader

	attributes
*	Bug fix: Template directive inside Javascript fragment triggers an error

0.9.3
*	NEW: F3::identicon generates visual respresentations of MD5 hash values

	to either REQUEST or SESSION global variables (a very unusual case)
*	Bug fix: F3::serve and F3::resolve render XML entities incorrectly

0.9.1
*	NEW: F3::http method for communicating with other servers via HTTP/S;
	F3::http sends a request to another host, respects HTTP 30x redirects,
	forwards headers received and returns content
*	NEW: F3::uriQuery method for converting an array of key-value pairs to
	a URI query string that can be used in HTTP requests to another server
*	F3::encoding method deprecated; Use new global variable ENCODING to set
	character set used for document encoding: default value is still UTF-8

0.9.0
*	NEW: F3::sitemap method for generating dynamic sitemaps!
*	NEW global variables:
	-	QUIET for toggling display of program output, RESPONSE still
		contains actual output - useful for unit testing;
	-	TIME returns time the application started
	-	TTL returns current page's cache timer (in seconds)
*	Provision for additional dynamically-loaded expansion packs
*	PHP extensions take precedence over user-defined classes in F3::allow
	method
*	Bug fix: session variables containing arrays not cleared properly

0.8.8
*	Fat-Free methods and templates now allow array dot-notation; for
	example - instead of @ERROR[code] and @my[multi][dimensional][array]
	(which are prone to unbalanced brackets), you can use @ERROR.code and
	@my.multi.dimensional.array, respectively
*	Added PHP's isset() and empty() language constructs to functions
	permitted in templates

	page is displayed
*	Code optimization in SQL handler
*	Bug fix: Erratic behavior when sending HTTP header expiration date to
	browser

0.8.6

	now more informative

0.8.4
*	Accompanying blog demo now includes an RSS feed/template
*	Bug fix: import files, unlike static methods and instantiated objects,
	are not called properly

0.8.3
*	Static methods and methods of instantiated objects can now be used as
	arguments to F3::route, F3::call, and F3::input

0.8.2
*	Speed improvements in the template engine
*	Better support for hosts that have zlib.output_compression turned on by
	default and browsers that don't accept GZip-encoded data
*	GZip output compresion level adjusted to reduce load on shared hosts
*	Some code optimization and additional controls in arguments passed to
	class methods

0.8.1
*	Fat-Free is now distributed in separate but tightly-linked modules: the
	Core Pack, which provides the base framework functionality, and the
	optional Expansion Pack, which works seamlessly with the Core and
	includes the CAPTCHA image generator, Javascript/CSS compressor, and
	thumbnail image creator; Nothing has changed in terms of framework usage
	and syntax - if you don't need the functions in the Expansion Pack, just
	delete the F3ex.php file
*	Stack trace behavior now consistent among different OS

0.8.0
*	NEW: database query caching; F3::sql method now provides a cache timeout
	as a function argument - similar to the F3::route method; speed gains
	can be significant specially in complex queries involving SQL look-up
	tables that contain static data
*	Dropped the generic BASE global variable to allow some flexibility in
	organizing directory structures and provide additional security
*	Improved the documentation on the use of IMPORTS, CACHE, GUI, and FONTS
	global variables; applications using previous versions of the framework
	could break with this re-definition of Fat-Free globals; it should be
	easy to restructure though, if all global definitions are in the main
	controller and master template
*	Cache engine now locks files before saving to prevent corrupted data
	from being retrieved by HTTP clients during high-traffic
*	Bug fix: F3::reroute fails when an application sends additional output
	after HTTP headers

0.7.5
*	Additional instructions in the documentation on the proper use of the
	cache
*	Fixed HTTP headers to support IE6 browsers
*	Some code optimization

0.7.4
*	Improved error/exception stack traces
*	Use of F3::minify method restricted to .js and .css files
*	Aside from PHP's $_SERVER and $_REQUEST variables, $_GET is now also
	auto-populated with values received in command line mode
*	Blog demo updated to use new Fat-Free mods
*	Bug fix: Session variables not saved when F3::reroute is followed by
	additional data sent to browser

0.7.3
*	More speed improvements: F3::cache now looks at If-Modified-Since HTTP
	request header and sends 304 Not Modified response instead of full
	HTML content
*	F3::minify method now gives better compression levels and supports JS
	conditional comments
*	Fat-Free scripts can be run from the command line; Example:-
		php index.php "/about"
	This will run index.php at the current directory and pass the /about URL
	to the framework. Routes are limited to HTTP GET. (POST doesn't make
	sense when used as an HTTP method on the command line). You can pass GET
	variables though:-
		php index.php "/min?base=gui/js&files=lib-core.js,lib-more.js"
*	Bug fix: setting BASE outside of Web root now works properly

0.7.2

*	More server- and browser-side performance tweaks
*	F3::minify method now uses a more conservative and safer compression
	algorithm
*	Cached documents now delivered properly with correct MIME content type

0.7.1
*	NEW: F3::minify method for combining/compressing Javascript/CSS files
*	$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] now automatically converted to human-readable
	string for easier routing/control declaration
*	Bug fix: URLs containing GET variables
*	Some code optimization

0.7.0
*	Changed license to GPLv3.0

0.6.5
*	NEW: F3::route method now allows you to specify a cache timeout; a
	previously-rendered Web page will be retrieved from cache if the timer
	has not expired; otherwise, the framework calls the route handler(s) to
	refresh the cached page
*	F3::serve doesn't render strings anymore; Use F3::resolve instead

0.6.4
*	Bug fix: stack trace levels are not sequential

0.6.3
*	TRACE global variable dropped in favor of boolean RELEASE variable;
	when set to TRUE eliminates stack trace from HTTP error page, but still
	appears completely in Web server's error log; set to FALSE to indicate
	the application is still in development (stack trace will appear in
	HTML output)

0.6.2
*	HTML output now automatically gzip-compressed if browser supports it
*	Default error page converted to XHTML 1.0 Strict
*	Passing 'user' as an argument to the F3::allow method now gives
	template designers access to user-defined functions in PHP scripts
*	F3::reroute method now allows use of template tokens

0.6.1
*	Bug fix: F3::serve causes break/continue error

0.6.0
*	Updated inline documentation
*	NEW: FILES global variable
*	NEW: MAXSIZE global variable representing maximum file upload size in
	bytes; use in the following manner:-
		<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="{@MAXSIZE}"/>
	Of course you still need to set enctype="multipart/form-data" in your
	HTML <form/> tag
*	Quick Reference Card updated to reflect the new F3::resolve method
*	Bug fix: character set encoding interferes with file upload behavior

0.5.1
*	Private method evaluate() renamed to F3::resolve and made public;
	Template expressions can now be embedded in string literals, so you can
	do this:-
		$x=F3::resolve('{@a}bcd{@e}');
	instead of:-
		$x=F3::get('a').'bcd'.F3::get('e'};.
*	Bug fix: <F3:check> directive behavior

0.5.0
*	Dropped the name F3::PHP to avoid being associated with another
	framework; It's now called "PHP Fat-Free Framework", or simply Fat-Free
*	Fixed inconsistencies in <?php ?> tags in the demo
*	F3::set and F3::qq methods now allow the use of template tokens inside
	string literals
*	Minor corrections in the quick reference card

0.4.7
*	ZIP archive now contains a quick reference card
*	Better error/exception handling

0.4.6
*	Documentation updated
*	Framework now emits *Error* in template expressions with syntax errors

0.4.5
*	XML tree traversal now uses post-order sequence to correct some bugs in
	processing of nested <F3:check> directives and improve performance

0.4.4
*	Bug fix: evaluation of complex expressions

0.4.3
*	NEW: F3::qq method encloses string(s) in double-quotes and prepends
	backslashes to characters that need to be quoted in database queries;
	Also adds commas if multiple arguments are present

*	PHP $_SESSION exempted from scrubbing to allow saving of non-scalar
	values in session variables
*	F3::call now allows function and include file chaining
*	F3::context method access changed to public
*	FORM[] global variable deprecated

0.4.1
*	NEW: CAPTCHA image generation via F3::captcha method

0.3.10
*	Better SQL error reporting
*	Additional check for empty <F3:true> or <F3:false> directives
*	Global variable DB['result'] now returns NULL when either an SQL error
	occurs or an empty SQL set is returned
*	Bug fix: file upload scrubbing

0.3.9
*	Code optimized
*	Bug fix: incorrect route handling of closures
*	Bug fix: <F3:repeat> groups contained inside <F3:check> directives
	that evaluate to false result in HTML fragment errors
*	Bug fix: Successive <F3:check> directives handled incorrectly

*	<F3:check> template directive can now handle TRUE/FALSE (if/else-like
	construct)
*	Relational operators && and || now allowed in Fat-Free expressions
*	Removed automatic session_start() from code; Should now be initiated
	manually by user
*	Bug fix: cache ignored when value changes
*	Lots of code optimizations

0.3.6
*	Added private method F3::scrub to automatically clean form fields and
	protect against code injection attacks
*	Removed global variable CHARSET; Added the F3::encoding command, which
	is a more convenient way of changing the default character set
*	Changed F3::error argument sequence so they mimic PHP's Exception()
*	Import files used as form field handlers now prohibited, due to their
	inability to pass/receive the values for use in validation, etc.
*	Changed the asterisk (*) to indicate an import file in URI route and
	form field handler chains to colon (:). This should make its usage
	distinct from the asterisk (*) in URI route patterns.
*	Corrections in the documentation
